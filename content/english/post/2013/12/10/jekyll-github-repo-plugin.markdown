I was actually very surprised that no one up until now had published a plugin
like this, I mean it's not like GitHub is alien to people using Jekyll for
their site. Most people I know even use GitHub pages to host their blog.
Why not? It's free and fairly reliable.

In my first attempt of writing the post about my current projects, I just pasted
links to a GitHub repository. I did not like that very much, and when I
discovered how my friend [Christoph](https://github.com/jarus) displays
repositories on his blog, it inspired me to write a Jekyll plugin and publish
it so everyone can use it.

If you look at his [blog](http://thelabmill.de) you will notice some
similarities ;)

####So here it is:

I realize a GitHub repo might be a bit too much for this. A gist would also
do, but I think it's a nice way to demonstrate the functionality. Feel free to
fork it to change the style.

Cheers
